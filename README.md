INTRODUCTION:

Air pollution is a major global challenge, causing 4.2 million premature deaths every year (WHO). PM2.5 and PM10 are the most dangerous pollutants affecting human health.
Asthma cases are rising worldwide, with 262 million people affected globally and 35 million in India. Even slight increases in PM2.5 can raise asthma risk by up to 20% in children.
Rapid urbanization and traffic lead to frequent, unpredictable pollution spikes, while existing monitoring systems only provide broad city-level data, not accurate local readings.
This project provides real-time pollutant detection and ML-based AQI forecasting, giving users timely insights to manage exposure and protect respiratory health.

OBJECTIVE:

1) To design an IoT-based real-time air pollution detection system.
2) To measure PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, temperature, humidity, CO₂, and formaldehyde.
3) To compute AQI using standardized CPCB/US-EPA methods.
4) To develop ML models (Prophet + LSTM) for short-term and long-term AQI forecasting.
5) To visualize historical and predicted AQI trends in an interactive dashboard.
